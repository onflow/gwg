# Node selection criteria for Flow

Anyone can run a Flow node. Nodes can be added to the Flow network if open slots are available. For access nodes, open slots are always available. 

For Consensus, Collection, Verification and Execution, slots are allocated based on the decision made by the governance working group.

The following is a first draft of the criteria to allocate new node slots to anyone who requests it. This criteria will be codified as the issue template (form) on the repo https://github.com/onflow/flow-validator/issues, and anyone who wants to run a node will be requested to provide those details. The Governance Working Group can then decide whether or not to assign slot(s) based on the issue submission.
